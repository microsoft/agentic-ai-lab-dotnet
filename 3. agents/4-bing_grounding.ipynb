      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "🤖 Assistant: The World Health Organization (WHO) currently recommends that both adults and children reduce their intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake. Moreover, a further reduction to below 5% of total energy intake is suggested as a sensible long-term health goal. Free sugars include all sugars added to foods and drinks, as well as sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices, and fruit juice concentrates.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, for an average adult consuming about 2,000 kcal per day, 10% energy from free sugars corresponds to no more than 50 grams (approximately 10 teaspoons) per day. For children, the recommended maximum intake is lower and varies by age.\n",
      "\n",
      "These guidelines aim to reduce the risk of unhealthy weight gain and dental caries.\n",

      "Please consult with a healthcare professional or nutritionist for personalized dietary advice.\n",

      "----------------------------------------\n",
      "🤖 Assistant: Recent research in 2026 indicates mixed findings on intermittent fasting (IF) for weight management:\n",
      "\n",
      "- A new study called the ChronoFast trial found that time-restricted eating (TRE), a popular IF type with an 8-hour eating window, did not improve insulin sensitivity or cardiovascular markers when calorie intake was kept the same. The main impact was a shift in the body's internal clock, suggesting calorie reduction, not simply fasting windows, drives metabolic benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Comprehensive reviews find that IF generally improves insulin sensitivity, lipid profiles, body composition, and promotes fat oxidation while preserving lean mass. It activates cellular mechanisms such as autophagy that reduce inflammation and oxidative stress associated with aging and chronic diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Another study highlights synchronized changes in the brain-gut-microbiome axis during intermittent energy restriction, linking IF to coordinated physiological adaptations that support weight loss and metabolic health.\n",
      "\n",
      "- A large meta-analysis of 99 randomized clinical trials showed that all IF strategies and continuous energy restriction reduce body weight compared to eating ad-libitum. Among IF types, alternate-day fasting showed slightly better results in body weight reduction compared to continuous energy restriction.\n",
      "\n",

    "1. **Accuracy** – Bing search results may include disclaimers or partial info. Encourage verification with credible sources.\n",
    "2. **Bing Query Display** – For compliance with Bing's use and display requirements, show both website URLs (in the agent's response) and Bing search query URLs. If the model includes citations, display them as well.\n",
    "3. **Limits** – Keep an eye on usage, rate limits, or policy constraints for Bing.\n",
